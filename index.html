      <p>Hi! I'm Connor, an Honours Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I started writing code when I was 11, when I built my first JavaScript text adventure game. Since then, I've been busy. I learn about new languages, frameworks,
        and tools as often as I can! Being a developer has been my dream for years now, and I'm proud to say that I'm making it come true. I work in frontend and backend code, although the latter is my specialty. Think I'd be a good fit for your company?
        Have freelance work that needs doing? Just want to say hi? Contact me at the bottom of this page, or view my resume using the button below.</p>

          </a>
          <p>AMSAT is a Twitter bot that I built in JavaScript, the summer before starting university. The Twitter bot in and of itself is fairly boilerplate; it uses RESTful and streaming Twitter API calls to monitor users, and tweet when it wants to. The
            more impressive feature of the bot is that it uses a Markov generator to construct tweets, which I built from scratch in JavaScript. This was the main challenge of the project, but also the most fun to make! Markov chains can be used in natural
            language processing, and are what power the predictive text on your phone. I use them to generate tweets from sample text, which I then push to the bot's Twitter account. The whole thing is hosted on Heroku, and runs more or less constantly.
            It doesn't make much sense (Markov chains aren't really known for their accuracy, as we all know from autocorrect), but it produces some pretty amusing stuff!

          <p>laz0rb0i is an integrated system that relies on user input and a series of motors and mirrors to create a laser light display on a flat surface. It was built using an Omega2, a laser pointer, several motors and mirrors, a motor controller, some
            home-grown C++ code to run the whole thing, and lots of love. Several challenges were encountered while building laz0rb0i, most of which related to actually controlling the motors using GPIO pins from the Omega2. These were overcome by creating
            a command-line tool which accepted user input, then translated it into a series of more basic commands the Omega2 could work with. Because the Omega2 is a computer in its own right, the project is run by SSHing into the Omega2 terminal.</p>

          <p>ASCIIfy is a Chrome extension which transforms all the images on a webpage into ASCII pictures. It's written in JavaScript, and built to use Chrome's extension format. It waits until the user clicks the actionable extension icon, then transforms
            all the images it can into ASCII art. It does so by reading in pixel data from the image, breaking it up into rectangles of consistent size, then finding the average grayscale value of each square. It then assigns each square an ASCII-encoded
            character based on its greyscale value. I encountered many challenges while working on this particular project. Working with images is difficult due to cross-origin security protocols, and in order to read the pixel data I needed to find a
            way around it. Luckily, I was able to find a solution by creating a new image with the same image data, and modifying its 'origin' property manually.

        <h2><span>PORTAL</span></h2>
        <h4>january - april 2018 | developer</h4>
        <p>My most recent work experience has been on the Portal developer team. During my time there, I worked with a variety of environments, languages, and platforms. My responsibilities included building an analytics tracker from scratch, which involved
          writing backend code in C#, database management using LINQ and SQL, and creating the frontend using Bootstrap, AngularJS, and plain HTML and CSS. I also redesigned the CECA (UWaterloo's center for Co-operative Education & Career Action) paging
          system, using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. This process included the creation of new functionality for the system, such as the ability to edit interview timeslots, message students, and more. In order to accomplish these tasks, I had to write CRUD
          endpoints on our backend, which I then tested on the beta server before pushing the new features to production. I also attended weekly Agile SCRUM meetings, used Jira to track task completion, and participated in storyboarding meetings once
          every three-week sprint.

        <h2><span>COSIMO</span></h2>
        <h4>july 2014 | intern</h4>
        <p>Working for Cosimo was my first experience with a development team, where I worked out of an office in Brooklyn. This taught me a lot about the development process, as well as teamwork and communication. Working for the team, I handled database
          cleanup and helped my boss with a few miscellaneous tasks he was working on as a freelancer. I also developed a pitch for the MTA (the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority), who were potential clients for us. To do this, I used Illustrator
          to create a map of the NY subway system, highlighting which stations were WiFi-connected and which weren't. I then used this to construct a subway art tour using the app we developed, which was a location-based audio platform that we marketed
          to museums, historical sites, and other locations which needed location-triggered audio playback.
